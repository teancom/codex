# Codex

Codex brings together the years of experience and lessons learned by
Stark & Wayne engineers after designing, deploying and managing their client's
BOSH and Cloud Foundry distributed architectures.  These best practices are
gathered together here to further mature and develop these techniques.

deployments:
